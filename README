BrainBrowser: an HTML5-based real-time 3D Neurological Data Viewer

BrainBrowser is a set of web-based, 3D visualization tools primarily 
targetting neuroimaging. It allows for real time manipulation and analysis 
of 3D imaging data whether it be precalculated maps, such as the MACACC 
Dataset (Mapping Anatomical Correlations Across Cerebral Cortex), or 
models provided by the user in MNI object, Wavefront object or FreeSurfer 
ASCII surface file formats, and data in one of the many currently supported 
formats (Minc, Nifti, object files, plain text). BrainBrowser also provides 
a Volume Viewer for exploring 3D MINC volume data. 

BrainBrowser uses open web-standard technologies such as HTML5, CSS, 
JavaScript and WebGL, as well as the open source libraries jQuery and
three.js.
