<div class="description"><p>The Surface Viewer event model can be used to listen for certain events 
occuring of the lifetime of a viewer. Currently, the following viewer events can be listened for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>displaymodel</strong> A new model has been displayed on the viewer.</li>
<li><strong>loadcolordata</strong> New color data has been loaded.</li>
<li><strong>loadspectrum</strong> A new spectrum has been loaded.</li>
<li><strong>rangechange</strong> The color range has been modified.</li>
<li><strong>blendcolormaps</strong> Two color maps have been loaded and blended.</li>
<li><strong>clearscreen</strong> The viewer has been cleared of objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>To listen for an event, simply use the viewer's <strong>addEventListener()</strong> method with 
with the event name and a callback funtion:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">   viewer.addEventListener("displaymodel", function() {
     console.log("Model displayed!");
   });

</pre></div>
